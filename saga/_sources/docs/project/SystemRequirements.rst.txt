System requirements
###################

You need a development environment with `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_, the `LTS release candidate of Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/>`_ (current LTS release is version 14), and `the current stable release of npm (version 7) <https://github.blog/2021-02-02-npm-7-is-now-generally-available/>`_.
Alternatively, you can install Node.js 16, which ships with npm 7.

If you are using Windows, use the `Windows Subsystem for Linux <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`_ with `Ubuntu 20.04
LTS <https://www.microsoft.com/nb-no/p/ubuntu-2004-lts/9n6svws3rx71>`_.

.. note::

   Windows is not included in the continuous integration tests, and hence if you encounter issues, you can vote in the `nRF Asset Tracker project discussion <https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-docs/discussions/21>`_.
