# Getting started

## System requirements

You need a development environment with the
[next LTS release candidate of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)
(right now version 12).

If you are using Windows, we recommend the
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
with
[Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/nb-no/p/ubuntu-1804-lts/9n9tngvndl3q?rtc=1).

## Install the Azure CLI

Follow the instructions from the
[Azure CLI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
in order to install the CLI.

Afterwards you should be able to execute the `az` command:

    az
