Storage of Historical Data
================================================================================

Bifravst uses `AWS Timestream <https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/>`_ to
analyze historical data. This offers developers a serverless, schema-less data
storage optimized for IoT with the capability of querying using SQL.

It provides a great combination of ease of maintenance, flexibility to changing
device messages and cost-per-use pricing.
