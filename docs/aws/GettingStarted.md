# Bifravst on AWS: Getting started

## Clone the project and install dependencies

Clone the latest version of the [bifravst-aws](https://github.com/bifravst/aws) project and install the dependencies:

	git clone https://github.com/bifravst/aws.git bifravst-aws
	cd bifravst-aws
	npm ci

## Provide your AWS credentials

In order to set up Bifravst on AWS you first need to set up a new account.

> ðŸš¨ It is recommended to install these resources in a blank AWS account to clearly separate them from your other projects. After you have registered your personal account, sign-up for [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/) and create a sub-account for Bifravst. You can have as many sub-accounts as you like, without extra costs.

Go to your [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/home) and add a new user for programmatic access and attach the `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess` policy directly. 
Note that this action will create a user which can do everything in the account, therefore it should only be created in an account dedicated for Bifravst.

Follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) to configure AWS CDK.

The recommended workflow is to use a *dotenv* plugin for your shell (e.g. [this one for Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/dotenv)) which will automatically export the environment variables it finds in a `.dotenv` file in the project folder:

Create a new file `.env` in the project folder and add the credentials that are presented to you after you have created the new user:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<value of Access key ID>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<value of Secret access key>
```

Also add your preferred region and your AWS account ID, which can be found [under *My Account* on the AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account), to the `.env` file.

```
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<your preferred AWS region>
AWS_ACCOUNT=<your AWS Account ID>
```

## Install Bifravst into your AWS account

This step sets up the necessary resources in your AWS account:

    npx cdk deploy

CDK will present you with a list of permission changes to your account, you need to review them carefully everytime you make changes to your set-up. You can however skip this step if you are adventurous: `npc cdk deploy --require-approval never`.
