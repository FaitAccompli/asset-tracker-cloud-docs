GPS Timeout configuration
*************************

Since the `firware currently does not support A-GPS <https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-docs/discussions/9>`_ depending on the device location acquiring a GPS fix can take a long time.
Therefore a timeout of at least 1000 seconds should be chosen in the web application.
