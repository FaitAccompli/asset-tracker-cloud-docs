The *Asset Tracker Cloud Example* enables developers to set up a real world IoT solution using one of the supported cloud provider and adapt the example firmware and software to fit their use case.
The *Asset Tracker Cloud Example* aims to provide answers and recommend best practices to the following questions:

* How to connect Nordic's cellular IoT chips to a specific cloud provider?
* How do devices send data into the cloud?
* How can data be sent to the devices?
* How can authenticated users and other services interact with the devices?
* How to upgrade the application firmware of devices while they are deployed in the field?
* How to develop a cellular IoT product that maximizes battery life, minimizes data usage, and handles unreliable connectivity gracefully?

.. note::

   Development progress is managed in the `The Asset Tracker Cloud Example Development GitHub Project <https://github.com/orgs/NordicSemiconductor/projects/2>`_.
