System requirements
###################

You need a development environment with `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, and the `LTS release candidate of Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/>`_ (current LTS release is version 14).

If you are using Windows, use the `Windows Subsystem for Linux <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`_ with `Ubuntu 18.04
LTS <https://www.microsoft.com/nb-no/p/ubuntu-1804-lts/9n9tngvndl3q?rtc=1>`_.

.. note::

   Windows is not included in the continuous integration tests, and hence if you encounter issues, you can vote for  `the issue in the Asset Tracker Cloud Example for AWS project discussion <https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-docs/discussions/21>`_
